# Offline PoC — f35a96df-83e3-41fa-ac88-14c28149451f

This PoC is intentionally offline and non-destructive. It verifies the
normalized finding metadata and, when a concrete current source location exists,
reproduces that source trace against the pinned audit checkout.

## Run

```bash
bash run.sh /path/to/audit-comp-ens
```

A successful reproduction prints `POC_OK`.
