# Offline PoC — bdb966b7-8334-4841-b2a0-af0a647fa9ac

- Severity: **Medium**

- Rule: `rpc-unbounded-jsonrpc-body`

This PoC is intentionally offline and non-destructive. It verifies the
normalized finding metadata and, when a concrete current source location exists,
reproduces that source trace against the pinned audit checkout.

## Run

```bash
bash run.sh /path/to/audit-comp-ens
```

A successful reproduction prints `POC_OK`.
